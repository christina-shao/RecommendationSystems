# RecommendationSystems
This project was completed in June of 2021 as a part of the HarvardX Data Science Professional Certificate program after having obtained about 2 months of experience in R.

## Code
Written in R, this machine learning algorithm is trained on user rating data of several movies across a hypothetical streaming platform. It then determines the overall effects of  each user, movie, genre, and release year on the rating via linear regression. The model then undergoes regularization to finalize the model.

## Report
Written as a medium to learn R markdown, the report contains analyses of the training and testing data sets, information on the development of the model, and the efficacy of the finalized model.
